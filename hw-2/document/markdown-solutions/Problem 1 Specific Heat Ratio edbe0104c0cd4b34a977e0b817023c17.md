# Problem 1: Specific Heat Ratio

### Problem Statement

The specific heat ratio is defined as $k = C_p/C_v$. Based on what you know regarding the differences between the types of specific heats do you anticipate it to be greater than, equal to, or less than one. Why?

### Solution

I expect it to be greater than one. Cp accounts for both internal energy changes and boundary work as a result of volume changes. Cv accounts for only changes to internal energy. Therefore Cp is greater than Cv, and the ratio is $>1$.
